This is my application for monitoring currencies values. I used puplic NBP api to get a specific data from a trusted source - https://api.nbp.pl/.
Data refresh time is equal one day, because it is a value that NBP has. 
Application shows current currencies values that NBP shares.
You can also se changes on market for specific currency (last 90) days and some additional information like average/max value from last 30 and 90 days.



This project has been create as my first project with wpf, so it has some wierd things.
